## Problem: 
People tend to self-identify and stay within their own social circle of friends and colleagues. They are unwittingly excluding others with different labels from their network

## Proposed Solution: 
Recommendation engine API that refers you to 5 likeminded people based on your reddit comments and subreddit of choice

### What makes this unique?:
Matches individuals based on talking points instead of personality questionnaires.
